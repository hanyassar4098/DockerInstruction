/**************************To change containers and images directory in this case, walk through the following steps:

1. Exit Docker Desktop

2. Shutdown WSL by executing this command:

wsl --shutdown
3. Export Docker Desktop data to your home screen (you can choose another place if you like):

wsl --export docker-desktop-data C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Desktop\data.tar
4. Unregister current Docker Desktop data:

wsl --unregister docker-desktop-data
5. Import the exported data to your desired location (for example, a folder named kindacode in the hard drive E):

wsl --import docker-desktop-data E:\kindacode\ C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Desktop\data.tar --version 2

////////////////////////////////////// Directory Change
Lets consider the current default installation path for docker is at C:\Program Files\Docker, 
and your target directory is at c:\Users\xxx\Docker , assuming the User Name is xxx.
Note this target path could be on any drive such as 

E:\Docker, and you have to create the directory before creating the junction.

Open cmd as an adminstrator and run
mklink /J "C:\Program Files\Docker" "c:\Users\xxx\Docker"

Go ahead and install Docker. The installer will think itâ€™s installing to
C:\Program Files\Docker but the files would actually be populated into c:\Users\xxx\Docker.
